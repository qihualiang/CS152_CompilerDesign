Phase 1: Lexical Analyzer Generation Using flex

Use the flex tool to generate a lexical analyzer for a high-level source code language called "MINI-L". The lexical analyzer takes as input a MINI-L program, parses it, and outputs the sequence of lexical tokens associated with the program.

HOW TO RUN
flex miniL.lex
gcc -o lexer lex.yy.c -lfl
./lexer fibonacci.min
